He perpetuated a projection and accusation about Clinton and Benghazi.\n\nChristie lied about Social Security being stolen by the government. It is still there, intact, solvent. He was going for a cheap sound byte.\n\nFiorina lied and projected false accusations about mostly women lost their jobs with Obama.\n\nTed Cruz couldn't stop patting himself on the back. He was right about the stupid ridiculous questions though. But since he always whines about everything, it didn't have the impact it would have had if someone else had said it.",

Only saw a couple disconnects ... only one who would be on a level playing field with Hillary \n\nThird place:  tie John Kasich and Chris Christie ... johnny was strong in first half, chrissy was strong in second half \n\nLast place: Ted Cruz ... CNBC called him out and his response was to get flustered and attack moderators ... He never did attempt to answer the question ... We saw the real Ted Cruz there.\n\nNext to last:  Donny Trump ... How much shibai can one man have, will he ever complete a thought?  If this were football he would have had 47 bullsh$t flags thrown on him\n\nThere 'sort of' award:  Jebbers Bush ... Didn't speak much, and didn't have much to say when he did other than \"I have a plan\" ... Appears clueless, his close sounded totally rehearsed ... He is so a decade and a half ago.  Did not stop the bleeding. \n\nFlub a dub award:  Marco Rubio ... Especially on finances\n\nSometimes I'm cogent, sometimes I'm not, and sometimes i might really be asleep award:  Dr. Ben Carsen.  The guy can be really good for a couple sentences and in the next couple you are like huh?  Think his star is fading.",

    "Comment": "The problem with Jeb's \"premise that the most vulnerable in our society should be in the front of the line and not the back\" is that his party and his policy ideas stand to bolster the bank accounts of the rich, white, straight, Evangelical Christian man, and not the struggling single parent who works two jobs, takes public transportation to both of those jobs, and relies on Medicaid and food stamps to make sure that his/her kids get at least the bare minimum that they need to survive. How is Jeb going to help put those people in the front of the line when Medicaid and tangible possibilities for wage growth are being ferociously targeted by the GOP? Jeb must push rightward to excite the GOP base enough to win the primary, but the policies the right wants are the policies that further exacerbate the problems that keep the most vulnerable in our society at the back of the line, thus violating the very premise upon which he's based his core beliefs.",

Other than that I don't see how he has anything to offer our country.. and anyway he'd just end up tanking us further when he decides to go bankrupt.. as he tends to do.

Teach the youth the value of putting their time and money into achieving a goal. Save up to buy some new cloths, a car, save up for college. Garden with your kids ... teach them the value of hard work and how it will pay off in the end with patience and effort. Teach them the value of failure: trying again and again and learning from your mistakes well making good decisions until you succeed. The US can be great again.  Don't do everything for your children but challenge them to do well for themselves. Challenge them and give them constructive criticism as needed and emotional support. Challenge the youth instead of giving handouts and be surprised by their ability to rise to the challenge and surpass your wildest dreams and expectations for them. We can continue to be a great country but we must recover from our recent failures to inspire and lead the next generation that doesn't give them what they need but teaches them to work hard to get what they want for themselves.",

Government all over the world is a poster paged crusade. you dont want to belief all marriages have happy ending as it cost you a life time divorce in search for the perfect spouse. Learn to appreciate the good side of your government, leave the unspeakable to the good heavens so that you reserve the left over sanity in you to train up your kids to become d good seeds of the society and of the entire human race. From the time of  George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, through till the time of Theodor Roosevelt, William Howard, Franklin D Roosevelt, John F Kennedy, Richard M Nixon, Ronald Reagan, George W Bush, & Barrack Obama. All government is for everybody and at the same time built for nobody. We need to find constructive channels to vent our opinions and citations whenever disapointment is metted down on us out of over anticipation. Its not that all government are bad but bad become worse when we expect too much from government. too much of it is like getting high on booze, cracks and opium in that in the end you just have to admit that you were so stupid beyond verbal description as your habit has taken a toll on you. you may need to read The Albion seed by David Hacket Fischer, Culture of honour and the Psychology of Violence in the South by Richard Nisbet & Dove Cohen. Always remember someday you may become the President. A man and his words are two common inseparable entity. You are what You preach. Humans kills humans, Apes kill apes. Humans and Apes are the same. Welcome to this planet of apes. But you dont necessarily need a tail between your legs to tell you are one of us.   Politics is nobody's father's business, so never take it so personal. Politicians are just regular businessmen from higher plane.  Your words today may be your undoing tomorrow as it may come knocking at your door step without a short notice. Dont stew yourself in your own juice before your goose is cooked. Chose your words carefully like a dignified crested rooster.",

Many are not well educated nor have they traveled out of this country.  Their main source of \"news\" is Faux news.  \n\nWe have become the laughing stock of the world because of this idiot, like our days with Dubya. This too shall pass, folks.\n\nI \"liked\" BBC page so I could get access to better news, and more international as well, not to see every few hours, something about this narcissistic clown!",

To their dismay, their plan backfired, creating the Chosen One (Anakin Skywalker); the very thing that could destroy the Sith. Where Plagueis saw danger, Sidious saw opportunity. The chance to use the Jedi's own legend to the Sith's advantage. Plagueis, being wise, sensed that Sidious was going to kill him so that he may take up his own apprentice. Plagueis fooled Sidious into thinking that he killed him. Plagueis then went into exile. After many years, he had learned that Sidious was killed by Anakin Skywalker who had also killed himself in the process. Knowing that he is safe from ever being destroyed by the Chosen One, he came out of exile. He then seduced Kylo Ren to the dark side and then used him to destroy the attempted New Jedi Order.",

The LGBT have fought so hard to gain marriage equality, for so many years, we simply cannot afford any Republican on stage tonight to tear up that great achievement and progress. Marco Rubio wants abortion banned in all cases, even in cases of rape and incest!? Really Marco? Democrats are fortunate to have Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton as top candidates, at least they focus on issues that matter to middle-class families, and not Wall Street executives and bank CEOS. We cannot afford any of these men to take the key to the White House this November. Ronald Reagan is turning in his grave seeing Ted Cruz and Donald Trump leading in all the polls. Whether you liked Reagan or not, at least the man worked with the other side to move legislation through, these guys are nothing but narcissists!",

Hey sander supporters take note Ted Cruz and Donald Trump are paid for by wall street who continue to be paid even though they won't show it. If republicans win they will be the down fall of this country and they won't be able to blame anyone but themselves. That's why people need to get out and vote so that none of these clowns never get elected. We don't want a repeat of Herbert Hoover, Ronald Reagon, Richard Nixon, or the Bushes.",

When did you ever demand to see Obama's college records or confront him with the fact that he likely registered as a foreign student or why his social security card is not Hawaiian.  When did you ever confront him about his book in which he claims his hero's were Marxist professors.  When exactly?  Or question Hillary about the constant lies claiming she had handed over all her emails and yet we know now that there were thousands she had not handed over and many are classified.  Or when did you ever hold her feet y to the fire in a debate as to why she erased her server when Congress had already begun an investigation and asked for access.  When?

Someone in Cruz's campaign erroneously jumped to the conclusion that Carson was dropping out of the race. Cruz called Carson and apologized. Carson asked him to apologize publically, which he did. Carson accepted the apology. To back up Tom Foreman's contention that Cruz is lying, Tom Foreman quoted several twitters that Chris Moore sent. Chris Moore was never mentioned.

Number 1 rule in a debate is the moderators should NOT become the story or convey in even the slightest way a favor or disfavor for a candidate.",

All they want is to pit the candidates against each other. Now it's all about rating and lining the pockets on Fox. Enough! Rather than be used any further for ratings Trump will now go and raise millions for veteran's. Much more admirable and important!! GO TRUMP!!",

For 7 years we have complained about Obama being a weak leader and he is pushed around by Iran, Russia etc. If Trump cannot stand up to FOX NEWS and say your wrong, how could he possibly stand up to foreign leaders. If Trump is willing to face the avalanche of twisted narratives this action brings and he is willing to risk losing such a close race in Iowa, for principle then he is EXACTLY what we want.

THE MEDIA, THE DNC AND THE GOP -ALL MULTIMILLIONAIRE OWNED ORGANIZATIONS, ARE RUNNING THIS COUNTRY AND THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT. It is a farce that the people elect their representatives. The media controls who and how any candidate gets exposure , and they want to elect the nominees by expressing personal views on them from news station owners ( Turner , Murdoch ), and specific reporters/commentators own ideology, anyone who goes against the \"powers that be\" the media kills in an instant. As for the democrats and the republicans, they are two faces of the same coin, dominating DC politics to the benefit of their interest groups, and all elected to serve to represent the people are only playing games , saying one thing and doing another, but always to the benefit of the status quo, which is to fill the pockets of the VERY RICH- make no mistake, both top republicans and DEMOCRATS are super millionaires. This corruption has to be stopped. WAKE UP AMERICA.",

He's never been able to answer questions, but that does not matter to his supporters so that can't possibly be the reason he's skipping the debate.

I have been a Fox supporter for years but after the way Megyn Kelly attacked Trump in that first debate, I stopped trusting the last news media outlet that I thought was really fair and BALANCED. I think it's a great business decision. It gives him more free publicity and shows he's not afraid to stand up for his beliefs. Shows some of the traits a real leader should have. No one is perfect, but in this case I believe Fox lost a lot of viewers because of the way they attacked him. I don't blame him one bit for not wanting to help Fox News line their pockets off of his attendance at the debate. Good for you Trump!",

    "Comment": "For someone that hardly ever follows politics, let alone watch a debate - I was totally appalled at the first debate hosted by Fox News! You call yourselves 'moderators' of the debate?? To me, it was more like 'antagonists'. It was totally disgusting. All those leading questions with the sole purpose of pitting the candidates against each other in personal attacks instead of questions about policy, qualifications and intentions. I felt for every candidate that night. And I don't blame Trump one bit for not wanting to be put in that same situation again. Fox News can't make it any more obvious that they are against Trump and are acting like it's their job to help his opponents undercut him any way they can. Disgusting. Like I said. Don't follow politics but am now because this country, specifically Washington needs to change. And another talking head in a suit spewing empty promises while using his position to line his pockets is not going to do it. I seriously thought that the media and all you News 'Professionals' were suppose to report the news. Not interject it with your own bias opinions and push those opinions on the public like you are the be-all and end-all authority on the subject. Megyn Kelly does come off as a pushy, opinionated and antagonistic trouble maker. I turn her off whenever she comes on. I can't stand the smug, know-it-all attitude she tries to 'report' the news with. Sorry Ms. Kelly, but someone should tell you that the news isn't all about you!",

I've never been a fan of Fox News, but send kudos to Megyn Kelly for standing up to him and posing questions that he is truly uncomfortable with.  His guttural reaction and sexists comments to and about her are a clear indication of this.  His narcissism is extreme and should he obtain the political power he seeks, he will endanger us from world enemies we know and those we don't yet know.  He is also a billionaire with multiple palatial homes.  How can he even begin to relate to the average American citizen?  Remember the interview where he called a million dollars a \"small loan?\"",

Mexico will pay for the wall, and very fast, when Trump stops all trade with Mexico, brings back all the manufacturing being done there by American companies , and leaves Mexico without the jobs they have stolen from American workers., and without anyone to buy their products. We don't need to trade with Mexico , Mexico can't survive without trading and selling to the USA ,no country on the planet can. The unfair one way trade deals the Obama administration has been making will stop. We will not continue buying more then we sell ,not just to Mexico , but also to Japan, China and Europe. Free Markets have to be fair trade markets, and we have to make the agreements to benefit the USA not Mexico. We'll see how fast Mexico renegotiates fair trade and the building of that wall and their controlling of illegal immigration when they lose the trade deals they now have.",

Leroy was an investor in property, his business name 1294 hair salon on wishon ave in fresno ca., is where i met him. Leroy owned part of the apartment complex at the nearest corner of his place of business, as well as owner of some additional property next to his place of bussines and home...\n\nLeroy Costa in that year was molesting me as a boy, in that year Mr. Congressman you were a State Assemblyman and Law Maker, who was about to run for Congress of the United States. Your uncle Leroy once told me he would cut Governor Gerry Browns hair on the runway at Fresno Airport. Leroy never mentioned you were a politician, I found this out on the next day after your uncle Leroy Costa was murder. On that day another molester name John came to my home asking for Leroys keys to his home because Sherice, Leroys daughter needed to remove items from his apartment before homicide detectives showed up to do their investigation (to remove evidence from a murder investigation site)., because YOU Mr. Congressman, then State Assembly (Law Maker) could not have any bad publicity while running for Congress, this is what was said to me by a close friend of your uncle Leroy Costa. Is it truth what John told me? I cannot tesify to Sherice statement, or your request. What I can TESTIFY in TRUTH is, prior to Leroy Costa death did he give me his 1964 chevy impala, champagne in color for my birthday January 15, 1968 on the day of a great giant walked the earth Dr. Martin Luther King. You Mr. Jim Costa were a giant then (state assembly), and continue to be today, but so was Leroy Costa. A Giant Mr. Congressman, Genesis 6:4., the verse found in the bible like unto the year of my 19(6:4) which was my gift from a Child Molester your uncle Leroy Costa, did his daughter  Sheriece, and you Mr. Congressman did deny me, my house the truth, and my car which is the righteous inheritance of mine, which included my crystal with a ivory unicorn in the center of it. Why? Well Leroy Costa cared for me, was molesting me, and he was born on January 15th, year unknown...\n\nI do not write to you to bring shame upon you, you may think I AM, but if you take into concideration your uncle is calling me from the spirit and reminding me daily! No the shame is mine Congressman because the Spirit wills me to confess the truth, and for years have I brought to you my truth, so has vengence been brought upon me, I AM acused of being a Child Molester, emails sent to me, puddles of muddy waters following me like a shadow that never leaves you, with swords and staves, to bring me down to with a shuvel (to shoel)...\n\nI hope the Costa Family enjoys their ride in my car, at my expense in the flesh and soul...",

Legal or not, was having a private server an ethical or wise thing to do? Was lying about it ok?

Poverty is much worse for women and minorities on his watch. He fans flames of racism on issues that aren't even racial. He's been an absolute failure and Hillary wouldn't be any better. \n\nTHIS IDIOT thinks her gender alone and endorsements from corrupt Leftist UNION leaders can roll her right into the White House... LIKE MOST Liberals she has her head in the sand and is blind to the ANGER and OUTRAGE of the AMERICAN PEOPLE.

The United States is a sacred and Holy Land, a special and chosen land above all other lands, by All Mighty God; Home of The Brave, Land of The Free.  This land is meant to be a free land forever.  A land where you can produce your own food.  A land where you can live in peace with your neighbors and carry your own firearms to defend yourself and protect your family and the homeland.  The Constitution of The United States of America and The Declaration of Independence and The Holy Bible are the solid Foundation of The United States of America.  Without these three Holy Oracles of God, this Nation cannot stand.  But it will stand because we have all three Holy Documents - Writings of the All Mighty God.  To me, all three are Holy Writ and they are sacred.   \n\nWhen you vote for me you will have to write my name in the ballot box section.  This can be done in all 50 States across America (where write-ins are accepted depending on state.). I will destroy Isis.

This has been bantered back and forth at each of their debates and yet they will talk out of the other side of their mouths and say the economy is booming and America is better off than it has ever been under Obama and the 2008 collapse is all the fault of George Bush and the GOP.

These people will have health issues in the future. They need a candidate that will stand up for them and protect them. They are going to need healthcare in the future and clean water. This should not be happening in America. The Republican Governor failed these people. The only candidate that has reached out to these people was Hillary Clinton. She does care for the average Joe. She has stood up for the rights of many.  Where is everyone else on this issue? Do they care? This is a real bad issue. Actions speak louder than words! I dont know who i will vote for.

If Isis attacks us what the hell is he going to do? Run and hide under a rock. The man has said nothing about how he will protect me in a crisis and that scares me and should scare all you people commenting on these posts. Clinton might have baggage, but she is running a more balanced campaign when discussing all the issues that effect America and not just the economy.",

The opportunity and expectation have been there for Secretary Clinton, yet the voters have still not been overwhelmed, and have begun to welcome the alternative. Over the time of her campaigns, a new generation of voters have entered the process. On both sides of the aisle, many are making clear their desire for something new, something different and visible qualities that align with where the nation is going rather than where it has been. On the Democratic side, we have that candidate in Bernie Sanders. We also have a good stay-the-course candidate in Hillary Clinton. Across the political spectrum, voters are making it very clear that the methods of the past need to stay there, and the future has begun. The time has arrived for change to what we've become used to, and willing to accept. The time has arrived for Bernie Sanders. Some are more comfortable with the known entity, and that's fine, but times are changing and voters can jump aboard and join the ride, or stagnate and be a part of our history, rather than the future.",

But we all must remember, must accept the facts.\n\nThe President stands alone always, often in opposition to key members of his/her own Party and the majority of American citizens.  Both Hillary and Bernie believe strongly in the same ideals: both would in a heartbeat establish a single payer healthcare system equal to any in Europe; both would if they could provide every hardworking student with a debt-free education, and send the bills to Wall Street billionaires who have for too long gotten a free ride on the backs of the working class.  So the election should not be about what a candidate believes in, on promises made.  \n\nWe should all vote on what can be accomplished.  Hold a wish in one hand and $5 in the other--which one will buy you a cup of coffee and a croissant?  \n\nI believe strongly in Bernie's ideals.  But I just do not believe for a moment that as president he will accomplish even one of his lofty goals, for he will stand in opposition in Washington to both moderate Democrats and Republicans.  President Obama, a pragmatic politician, has had to cajole, threaten and make compromises with Conservatives that have left a foul taste in the mouths of all Progressives. He has not accomplished all we wished to do.  But he has been a successful president.\n\nHillary's goals for the American people are more modest...achievable.  She has been careful not to make promises no president can deliver on.  \n\nI will vote, not for the wish, but for the  achievable goals.",

    "Comment": "Let's look at each candidate's base. \n\nBernie Sanders carries youth & activist voters as well as the ability to carry independents. The prior 2 are PASSIONATE about Bernie as a candidate. It's important to note that the youth vote does not turn out for a candidate that they do not feel speaks to them. Considering $hillary does terribly with voters under 30 and not well with the 30-40 group either...those people are more likely to stay home were Hillary to get the nomination, thus leading to overall low turn out and no gains in the House or Senate. \n\nNow let's look at Hillary's base. Lifelong Rank-n-file and corporate Dems. The Democratic Party could nominate a Boulder named \"Blinky\" and Hillary supporters would still vote for it. That is why $hillary supports call the question of a Bernie Sanders nomination, \"irrelevant.\" Maybe when they see today's polls where Hillary's 30 point national lead evaporated overnight to a national statistical tie (44-42). \n\nPersonally, I could NEVER vote for Hillary in a general election and will simply write in Bernie Sanders. Of course corporate and rank-n-file Dems will say I may as well vote Republican. Not true. This would be a PUNISHMENT vote to the DNC & Third Way Dems. They have ignored and written off  those who made the Democratic party...PROGRESSIVES. If the DNC continues to ignore us and attempt to screw Bernie Sanders out of the nomination, they DESERVE to suffer 4 to 8 years of psychopathic GOP rule. If that's the only way to get it through their thick skulls that you can't move a country forward by catering to the top 1%, so be it. #BernieOrBust #FeelTheBern",

They are tired of being told \"NO it can't be done!\" \nIt can be done, and Bernie has logical answers and plans to get America back on the path.\n\n You know how people are always complaining about our government doesn't do enough to take care of their own people here in America? Bernie Sanders WANTS every person to have the ability to have healthcare as a right! He wants Americans to be educated, and he wants hard working families to break past poverty levels. \n\nBernie Sanders knows I work full time, and can't afford daycare to do so. He also knows I may be able to have health insurance under Obamacare, but can't afford premiums, co-pays nor medication. Bernie knows that all Americans deserve to be treated equally, and deserve to have the same rights to good health and education. Want change? It begins at home. \n\nBernie Sanders wants us to focus on taking care of our people, and not so much on taking care of our interest in foreign countries because the oil companies, pharmaceutical companies and big banks bought used money for favors. \n\nHillary says she wants to support middle class and lower class families, and women, but can't do so with clean hands.",

They don't work, they don't pay any \"real\" taxes, they don't understand how the system works (or the world for that matter), they're being brainwashed, etc. What I say to all of you is you're repeating what's happened for generations. The elder generation becomes stagnant, stuck in their ways and demeaning the younger generation for their progressive views. At one point your parents said the same of you, and so on. You have amnesia about how your generation battled to better the world and say, fight against segregation, fight for women's rights, just to name a few. You fail to acknowledge the fact that we are doing the same thing you did, by making the world better for all and not excepting the idea things can't, or shouldn't change. You fail to acknowledge the fact that your generation has depleted SS, continued to trash our planet (maybe climate change wasn't mainstream, but it became increasingly evident in your day that humans were changing the world and its inhabitants for the worse) with no regard over how you leave it for us, your children, nieces, nephews, etc. You continuously voted for people that increasingly shipped our jobs to foreign countries, rolling over and accepting it. That, or just plain didn't pay attention. You fail to acknowledge the fact the economy has changed considerably since you've been young. You fail to realize that it's harder for our generation to get by with the same amount of income, let alone make the same income with the same amount of work. That it's not nearly as easy to raise a family of our own and/or buy a home as it was for you! It's harder for us to afford to get a college degree! I could go on forever. Guess what... Just because you see a few bad apples and make assumptions doesn't give you the right to bash the majority. Just because you don't agree with us entirely doesn't give you the right to bash us! I live in MN, just across the Red from ND and I can say that my generation isn't lazy! Some of us work 2+ jobs! We do pay \"real\" taxes. We are paying attention to how the world works and challenge the status quo, just as you had before us. We are a compassionate/passionate generation. We realize and do a lot more than you would like to admit. If you look at your children and think otherwise, maybe you should look back at yourself. Maybe you should ask yourself what you did to shape the way your child acts/thinks. Maybe you shouldn't have given them everything, ignored them, etc. Maybe you should stop with the do a I say, not as I do. Maybe you should take your own advise of, \"If you have nothing good to say, don't say anything at all.\" Maybe you should look at us as a hole, in our intirety! Guess what elders... Your time on this planet is coming to an end much sooner than ours and we deserve a say in how it is shaped just as much as you. Get off your high horses and shove off! Having said all this, their are still dreamers among you. People looking to better the world around us no matter what the cost/what it takes. People that do care about how things will be when they are gone. People that look to our generation with a sense of pride and hope. I commend you for biting your tongue and not making them same mistakes some of your peers are. To my generation... If you aren't already, do your research! Be informed and take on your responsibilities in this world, including the responsibility of voting in people that dream big and better this world. Don't listen to what others have to say. Don't be scared out of going with your heart and brain. Make informed decisions! Hold yourself responsible for your actions and how they effect not only yourself, but others, including those to come! Don't be afraid of the unknown! Instead embrace it! As we learn more and more, nothing comes easy! I stand by my endorsement of Bernie Sanders proudly! I stand by my view that he is not only a more genuine, caring person than Clinton and would be a better leader! Just because she could be the first woman president doesn't mean you should vote for her. There are better women out there for that, Warren being one! I trust Bernie's judgement, in all aspects, over her experience any day of the week. I (hate to hashtag) #FeelTheBern and view him as the #BernDawgSaint",

    "Comment": "What is on Bernie's PROGROM (spelling intentional) list? A self loathing Jew - BERNIE SANDERS SPENT MONTHS AT MARXIST-STALINIST KIBBUTZ\n\nBernie Sanders has a complicated history with Israel. Back in the 70s, he called for denying weapons to Israel before the Yom Kippur War. His voting record on Israel in the Senate was spotty at best. He called for \"aggressive normalization\" with the terror state of Iran at the Democratic debate. But defenders keep mentioning that he and his anti-Israel brother Larry, who is with the Green Party in the UK, spent time at a Kibbutz in Israel.\n\nWhen Bernie Sanders entered the race, there was a good deal of speculation in Israel which Kibbutz he was in. The Sanders campaign didn't seem interested in answering the question. Now we know why.\n\nIn 1963, Sanders had told Yossi Melman that he had been at Kibbutz Sha'ar Ha'amakim as a guest of the Hashomer Hatzair youth movement.Israel had all sorts of Kibbutzim affiliated with various political movements. Hashomer Hatzair was about as bad as it got.\n\nKibbutz Sha'ar Ha'amakim had been co-founded by Aharon Cohen, the Arabist, who was a regular critic of Israel and opponent of its policy. He was arrested for spying for the USSR in the 50s.\n\nHashomer Hatzair was a Marxist organization. While the USSR purged most Zionist and Jewish groups, they waited until 1927 to ban Hashomer Hatzair making them the last group to be outlawed. Other left-wing groups described them as Leninist and even Stalinist.",

That's bad news for the repubs because Brenie has attracked a large bloc of youthful, intelligent voters.  if Bernie is the nominee and the wave of youthful support shows up to vote, do you think they will also support the repub congressional candidates favored by the old white anger, fear, and greed crowd?  Not likely, which means the repubs will lose the Senate and see thier numbers decline in the house.  GO BERNIE #FeeltheBern  Don't you just love a revolution?",

Obama and his new Opioid Policy - well first He'd have to tell Hillary about it because she sure knew nothing about nothing when it came to the Heroin and other Opioid Problem in the USA - She left out Drug Gangs - Drug Gang-Bangers in L.A. for an example -  almost 50% are illegals  - CBS 60 MINS. reported - there are 450 drug gangs in L.A. with a membership of 45,000. Wonder if Hillary even knows it or not - its not a group it is major drug gangs intent on destroying lives - 1,000s of lives - not just 3 and an Ambassador, but 1,000s all across the USA - Yes Hillary must be on drugs as well - or living in a fantasy world with Bill - please Hillary reference:  60 MINS. Jan. 2016, or www.streetgangs.com or watch the National Geographic Channel Series DRUGS INC. and tell Obama to watch as well - you both could learn a few things - MAYBE!",

If the Bernie supporters listen to their candidate well, they'll understand that they must stay involved continuously after the easy step of placing a vote, and most citizens just don't and won't. Revolutions will require peaceful demonstrations, marches, electing like-minded individuals in every election. Women didn't earn the right to vote, and other important rights, by merely voting. Ask yourselves if you're ready to do what it takes to create this revolution of which you yearn. HRC really means it when she says she'll work her heart out to make this a better world. Don't let the millions the GOP are spending to annihilate Hillary influence you to vote against many of the things we Dems hold near and dear. Neither candidate is perfect(who is?), nor is the two party system perfect by any means, but after a comparison on many levels, it's GO HRC all the way!! \n\nFor anyone who is on the fence, I encourage you to watch HRC's '08 concession speech. It's a poignant speech and a clear indication of where Hillary's heart has been for a very long time.",

A person in her position as Secretary of State or any one who has a security clearance is to know what is classified and what to do if they see or receive something that is suspected of being classified and not properly identified or handled. If her assertion is that she doesn't know, then by all accounts, she was not qualified for Secretary of State or qualify to be President of the United States. For the FBI and the Justice Department to ignore her violations of laws concerning classified materials is a dereliction of duty at least or collusion with Hillary and the White House at worst (since Josh Ernest- Obama's press secretary comment and Hillary's assertion last night that the the investigation does not include her and she can guarantee she won't be charged).",
