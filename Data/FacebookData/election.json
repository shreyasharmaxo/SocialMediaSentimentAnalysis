    "Comment": "Hillary thinks saying 'everybody accepts big money' somehow exonerates her from being part of the establishment problem. She is the leading tip of the rigged system, getting the most Wall Street money, while having the fewest individual supporters. She's living in a skewed reality bubble with the other establishment money cronies.\n\nAlso, Bill Clinton and Obama were never Secretary of State and both had no foreign policy experience. Yet, they did great. And Bernie would never pick someone like Hillary to be secretary with her poor judgement. So clearly, foreign policy experience is NOT needed for the job. Period. The end. #BernieNotForSale",

It is now a general understanding by the public that the HK Police will not arrest those people because they are coomunities with strong pro~china political influences and supporters of our current Chief Executive Leung Chun Ying, these people sort of became like those of \"untouchables\" .",

I think that would be a fantastic start to financing a fantastic Border Wall. \nHell, that's how we can finance the deportation of all those illegal immigrants too. We send hundreds of millions of dollars to Central and South American countries in finacial aid. And they still come to our country. Seems a better use would be to use that aid money to send them back, and then allow the best and the brightest back into our country legaly if they so choose. \n\nThe thing is, a politician would never consider this possibility, but a businessman would.",

Imagine how bad inflation would be without our 3rd largest trade partner. Any extra  charge to them would come back to us the consumer.

Secondly most of the illegal immigrants coming through Mexico aren't even Mexican. They're Central American refugees trying to escape the gang problems mass deportation have created. So they're is more immigrants because of deportations. In essence the solutions you people have in mind will never work; we must find and fix the root of the problem or this cycle will be endless.",

People have gotten so hung up on the fact he isn't a politician they make assumptions that he is a bad man. So what! He is saying things that need to be said. Most people won't like it but it has to be said and done. This country is so worried about other nations when we should be focused on fixing our problems first not other countries.",

The top export destinations of Mexico are the United States ($269B), Canada ($23.6B), China ($7.76B), Spain ($7.31B) and Brazil ($5.81B). The top import origins are the United States ($180B), Thus we lose little by not accepting Mexican goods or taxing them exorbitantly. While it would be crippling for Mexico to have the USA refused goods. Thus Mexico can be forced to pay for the wall. Not by receiving a bill, but by taxed goods coming into the USA.

Now, I am reading about how Trump pissed off the Mexican president.  In response, Trump tries to bully him.  Trump is out of control.  It is really scary.  All these country's are laughing at us for allowing this man to have so much influence.  They are hoping we elect him.  It will weaken the nation.  For those who support him, America will be anything but great if he is elected.  We will be in multiple wars since his solution to every problem is war and violence.  We will be weak because we don't have enough ammunition to protect us from Trump's big mouth.  I cannot believe Americans are standing behind a man that in ONE day has tried to bully the Mexican president and making crude comments at his rally.",

    "Comment": "Vidya And Avidya\n\nVedas clearly state: knowledge of vedas is called brahma vidya or simply vidya (knowledge of the truth); all other forms of knowledge fall under avidya (or ignorance of the truth). You know that I have started a series in the facebook imparting brahma vidya, the knowledge of truth, as given in 108 Upanishads!\n\nMy long professional experience in teaching and research in many fields other than vedas, unfortunately, encouraged me to write in various social media platforms on diverse issues as education, economic development, religious amity, anti-national activities of opposition parties, media and religious fanatics etc! After studying vedas and getting engaged in imparting veda knowledge, I should really refrain from all other activites that can cause distractions and affect my main Vedic work.\n\nSo I have decided to concentrate only on spreading the veda message across the world! My posts are public and people are free to read my posts and use the knowledge to rise themselves to a higher level! Those who choose to criticize the Vedas too are free to do so! Vedas need not be defended by anyone; if intellectual debates over 5000 years have accepted vedas as the basic premises, nothing more is needed to defend them!\n\nIn short, no more posts from me on topics other than Vedas and related literature; of course, all important scientific discoveries and concepts supporting the Veda assertions will be presented! No more presidential election, Donald Trump, Modiji, Kejriwal, Mughal and British invaders, dismal education system etc. from me! Only vidya and no avidya! Be certain, avidya is the root cause of all evils in the world! There is one final request: those who like my series may do the needful to spread this divine veda message to others! Good luck to all!",

Why are so many people who have no clue about business even commenting here?  Go play in your sand boxes and leave these forums to people who know about international trade.

    "Comment": "Okay Trumpbots, let's look at this from a different perspective:\n\nYou want the Mexican government to pay for a wall they neither want nor need, which means the cost will be passed on to the law-abiding Mexican citizens (for again, a wall that they neither want nor need).  In essence, you're forcing taxation on the people of Mexico (again, the law-abiding ones that are staying where they belong) without their consent. I'm sure patriots of old like Patrick Henry would be spinning in their grave. \n\nI'm sure the irony is lost on people as lacking in cognitive prowess as Trump supporters...maybe they just don't think of Mexicans as people with inalienable rights like us 'Muricans.",

If the Americans and the Canadians live down there, they should stay and give up their passports, then they can be natives of Mexico.I know who is going to win. I like reading the responses they make me laugh and make my day. Have a Great Day",

American people MUST understand trump metaphors are all false promises, impractical and non attainable . American people must check the history of US ECONOMY of past 30 years. Bush senior waged war to sell arms to Middle East got paid 28 billion in those times for his services . Then came Clinton and US had the best time of the Internet boom which has advanced American clout all over the world the came the Bird brain Bush and 9/11 was afghan problem and he waged war on Iraq without any planning of aftermath and the US economy went spiraling down. What Clinton made for the US bush destroy including the economy. Fortunately Obama saved the massive GM AIG and other banks to save the face of America even the. The republicans wanted to bring the government and economy to dead halt. If the American  people realize that seeing republican bitterly fight in the debates all they want is war and make million era a billion era with the middle class people completely ignored. If you listen to trump bragging it's \"I will do this and that \" without any concrete proposal. How can you the American people elect a crook with bloated ego to the helm of the most powerful the most democratic the most intelligent and dynamic country on the earth.

Taxes could be levied on their exports to this country the likes which they have never seen. 18,000 companies with US investments operate in Mexico. If he entices them to come back to the US by slashing their Corporate tax rate. It would send their economy into the ground. Trump is a businessman and a very successful  one.

    "Comment": "have you seen ANY news from Europe in the last six months?  Geez.  When Germany has protests with signs saying \"Trump is Right\"... what does that tell you?  They have tens of thousands of confirmations of ISIS and Al Queda posing as refugees.. ISIS stole a freaking passport making machine with US passport supplies back in October... hmmm... only an idiot would think that this is about religion..it's about the safety of America...every day there are more stories coming out of Europe about the refugees, and the most loving and accepting of the countries over there are rounding them up and sending them back.  Norway is paying them to just leave.  Germany's economy is collapsing under the stress, there have been numerous bombings, stabbings, and mass rapes across the entire European continent.. take five minutes and really look at the world around you...what is going on outside your little bubble.  This is about making sure America does not land in the same boat. Donald Trump wants to protect us that's what he wants to do and restore our country to strength and large workforce.",

It is now a general understanding by the public that the HK Police will not arrest those people because they are coomunities with strong pro~china political influences and supporters of our current Chief Executive Leung Chun Ying, these people sort of became like those of \"untouchables\" .",

Second, how can anyone still believe in Trump. all he's made up of is insinuations, criticism and exaggerated comments. He doesn't have any specific solutions. Except to say. I will make America great again. But, can't say how. I have never seen anyone, so shallow, go so far. Get past the angry aggressive attitude. Be fair to yourself. John Kasich is the only Republican that has the ability, ideals and capability to run this Country. That's even close to Hilary, which is still second to her. W/ Hilary's experiences, First Lady, Secretary of State and Senate, Along w/ Her husbands record as president ( who will be in the White House w/ her). There is no one, that even comes close, to having more knowledge, back ground and success w/ the economy, foreign policy, global warming and world threat than the two of them. For those that, justifiably, hold Bill's indiscretion against him. I say it was wrong, but, if Hilary has accepted it, than so can I for the benefit of the Country..Also, Benghazi was a horrible mistake. It's hard to overcome. But, if you think that any of the candidates are above making the same mistake or worse. Your kidding yourself.",

While Trump panders to the right, Sanders panders to the left. In the real world of American politics, a plan that focuses on the MIDDLE is much more likely to actually come to fruition. That's why I think neither of these two would have any success as president. Both fail miserably to acknowledge and respect the complex nature of American society/politics and each promotes his own type of divisiveness, not unity.",

Now, look at the faceless profiles, dogs, cats. Flowers, really..the Clinton foundation has employed hundreds of people that use thousands of fake Facebook pages. She is being dishonest. Now, look at the rally pictures of her supporters. Hair up, hair down, hat, no hat, its the same people. She supply's her own crowds. Don't you get it? Its the Clinton foundation. Its what it was designed for. Its not a charity its an election machine designed to fool the masses...please do your own research. Here is an example. If you watch the news your aware of the water crisis in flint Michigan, and you have probably seen Hillary Clinton and Chelsea Clinton talking about it. Hillary talks about it in her speeches, she talks about it on her Facebook page, she talks about it in the television interviews.... She expresses great concerns over it...but all she does is talk, talk, talk, talk. Look, if you go to Walmart and buy a single bottle of water and send it to a random resident of flint Michigan then you all by yourself would be doing more for that resident than the Clinton campaign and Clinton foundation COMBINED!!!! Ask yourself, why is Chelsea always doing something other than working at the foundation? She make $600K a year. If she's not needed then why are the people who are actually doing the work being paid EQUALLY? PLEASE DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH... DONT LISTEN TO ME, GO LOOK UP THE FACTS FOR YOURSELVES..",

There's not a lot of difference between the Wall and UHC...Trump is going to get Mexico to build and pay for the wall, and Sanders is going to raise taxes and give everyone free health care.

    "Comment": "I would not vote for any of the two.   Since extremism to the left and to the right there is no difference.   Is like extremely cold or extremely hot, either way you put it is harmful.\nYou do not shower with extreme cold water or very hot water.   Common sense in general call for a middle grown.   Socialism in a capitalist country will not work.   Is something that is unfair for the person who work hard to raise a family and show the family the values and the way to develop and advance in life with hard work and sacrifice to get ahead in life.   Socialism can get out of place and fall in a communism, and under Socialism, revel people can create havoc by force and can create a government like in Cuba and Venezuela.   \nIn the part of extreme right Conservatism falls in a position where the Government want to control your religion, your way of life, the prejudice they have against people of color.   Trump in Office will end the  equal employment Opportunity, will end the right to Unions in this Nation, the NAACP, the Commission Against Discrimination, will end the right to peaceful assembly.\nMany of our rights, liberties and freedoms will be taking away by tapping phone lines and Internet of every individual.   It will promote the White Supremacy in all the States and U. S. Will become more like taking the U. S. to over 60 years back.  U.S. will be a democracy just for the rich and millionaires and more like a slavery for the middle class and the poor. True democracy only exist in the middle.   Being progressive or Moderate. It is like dealing with the faces of two evils.   Even Jesus plead to the masses not to be neither too hot or to cold but a person of the middle.   That is where common sense rest.",

It might be nice for American's to get free stuff off the government for a change.  I could use a lower interest rate on my student loans.  I know that even if we get free education for all now, we will pay it back in taxes later but the government will have to flit the bill now. So this will be  a tough decision, Sanders or Trump. I do know I will be looking forward to the debate between these two. I am on the fence, between Sanders & Trump. Hard to decide now.  so I will watch these debates carefully & see & evaluate what caucus is doing.   I have time to decide till November.",

The very FIRST answer by all 3 was \"with the hi price of college, he promises to make it free\"...good grief Charlie Brown. We also have to remember that we live in a global economy now more than ever. US products USED to be in hi demand. 2016? Not so much. Companies like Walmart almost insist on products being made in China. Watch an episode of Shark Tank. The very first thing they ask prospective investees(?) Is how can you get the cost down, and having it made in China is always the 1st alternative. Bernie believes that it's still 1960 and everyone in America is buying a Buick or a Chevy, and that everything we buy can be made in the US by workers making $15.00 an hour. Sadly those days are over.",

And just seeing this post confirms there desperation. \nMy question's for people are\nDo you want other countries to start buying from America, or continue to profit from other countries?\nShould corporations be able to stash money overseas and not pay taxes on it?\nDo you shop at Walmart? If so, your already paying rent for the employees who work for the richest company in the US. \nWould you like your kids to go to college if they made good grades and you couldn't afford it?\nIf you have to go to the hospital or someone you love has to, should they leave broke, or die because they don't want the bill?\nShould our next president be bought buy Banks, Pharmaceutical companies?\nOr by a man who has no political experience at all, just a big bank account and a lot of hate?\nDo you know why the Republican party will not announce that climate change is real? Here's the answer.....then they'd lose money from there donors. Who cares about the world they leave for there children and grandchildren.\n I will say I have no kids, no intention of having kids, and work 40 hours a week, and I live in poverty. Yet I would gladly pay a little more in taxes to help our Country move forward in the right direction.\nAnd how quickly people forget we bailed out the banks, the car industry, Wallstreet, with OUR money, and got nothing back when they became successful again.\nWho is the candidate who will change this?.....there is only ONE Bernie!!!",

    "Comment": "I am a 48 year old male born and raised in Flint Michigan .  I am a member of the Democratic National Committee and a Union Ironworker I an also a Military Vet. I studied political science at the University of Michigan too. This is a small essay on why I'm voting for Bernie.  I hope you will read this and consider what I've said.  Thank you!\n\nI was a Hillary supporter.  I didn't like Bernie. Thought he looked like a wild scientist more than presidential. \nMy daughters are in college and have never cared about politics.  All of a sudden I heard them having in depth political conversation about the direction this country is going. They were talkin about Bernie Sanders. They said they really liked him.  They didn't like him cause he has style or because he's cool.  They like him because they are tired of the wars their generation is fighting.  They're afraid of the Next War having a draft. They believe in his message.  Having been in military conflicts. w 7th Special Forces Group (Airborne). Trainig Contras in Nicaragua. I can empathize. \n\n I agree wall street is rigged. I agree banks need to be broke up the way Republican President Teddy Rosevelt did with the first anti trust laws to break up momopolies.\nI think we need a masive shake up in DC and wall street.  We need Campaign Finance reform to remove \"McCain/Feingold\" and \"Citizens United.\"  I think Hillary is too close to the problem to be able to fix it.  I have trust issues.  Why won't she release the transcipts to all the speaches she gave to the banks??  Cause they love her and she thinks the banks have been midunderstood???  She has Super Pacs and big$ banks financing her campaign.  Bernie has over 3 million individual campaign donors averaging $27.00 each.  And he's pulling in as much as her.  That alone proves Super Pacs are not necessary. The power is still eih the people who vote. Bernie has experience of 30 yrs fom Mayor to Congress to the Senate.  He knows his way around.This election means alot to everyone. But not as much as it does to our Youth. I have to consider the welfare of my kids  It may be the most important election of our lifetime but especially theirs. WW3 is coming trust me! With a draft including women. There's a bill in the house right now to add women to the draft.  Why if they don't expect a big war would they need a draft?  This election is the biggest of our lives and I have to consider my kids and the future.  Too often we live in the here  and now without thinking ahead.  Iraq is an example.  G.W. didn't think about the 10 yrs down the road or the power vacuum attacking Iraq would leave.  Bush Sr. and Col. Colin Powell did.  It's why they stopped short of Bagdad in Desert Storm and set up no fly zones that were working.  I think like a soldier.  I smell death, you never forget, I see the blood, the death of children.  I see their bodies in the street bloading. So many that they rot for days weeks before we can bury them.  The sickening sweet smell of dead bodies is everywhere.  Then there's the wide spread distruction.  The desimation of historical sights that have lived through a thousand years of war til this one.  Thousands of years of history that lynks us all together... gone forever.  Our kids and grand kids will never be able to see these beautiful historic sights or learn about them.  They're gone now.  War is a terrible terrible thing and too often we set here insulated from it and forget it's even going on.  Comfortable in our warm homes while the war rages on.  \n\nThen there's the war that comes home with them.  PTSD, Maimed, loss of limbs etc. It never ends for many of them.  The last war generation.  (Vietnam)  Brought us Kennedy and Johnson. It was the young college aged kids that voted for them. Did they make a mistake?  I ask only because Hilary. Madeleine Albright and Gloria Steinberg has insinuated that's what our young people are doing now. Telling them they're just following Bernie Sanders for the boys or going to hell if they don't vote for Hillary. I am going with my gut. I'm supporting my kids.  My life is set.  I wont have to fight.  I'll be ok.  They wont and they have their whole lives ahead of them.  I don't want to see it snuffed out for a unjust war that started on lies of WMDs.  We had a right to get Bin Laden in Afghanistan, that was a just war. We should have stayed focussed there and Laden would have been caught long long before.  \n\nBernies strategy for the Middle East  makes sense .  He wants to commit no US troops  on the ground .  We can give air support  intelligence  and financing .  The only U.S. ground troops will be Special Forces in an advisory capacity .  All ground fighting will be done by a coalition  of neighboring Muslim nations .  The Saudis  the Jordanians  the Turks  and the Egyptians. If United States were to invade it would be perceived by terrorist as a holy war... Christians against Muslims. And that is exactly what ISIS wants. The war must be fought Muslim against Muslim in order for it to be viewed as a just war to them. They have to clean up their own backyard. No more young American men and women shedding their blood for a war that should have never taken place had Middle East not been destabilized by the Iraqi invasion. Bernies plan makes sense and his attitude, fortitude, experience and judgment is what we need as our Commander and Chief right now. This is my oppinion.  It's why I support Bernie and I hope you will join me! Feel The Bern!!",

And in no way shape or form are the angers and frustrations that Trump supporters share even remotely the same as those of Bernie Sanders supporters. It simply isn't true.

This country is better under a Democratic leadership but let's not ignore the Republican whining... can't wait til all is said and done and we can just move on and live and respect the President in power. Oh yeah President Obama is the most disrespected president ever. He accomplished so much but certain people just see the color of his skin and keep insisting he's Muslim when he smokes, drinks beer and eat pork. Thanks to Obama the world sees USA as a superpower again. I think Hillary should be President and Bernie her VP!",

Everything I write something they tell me speak English you go to the hospital for flu shots.. I know one language and I go to VA hospital from medical and treatment I'm falling apart...

Thank God somebody to listen to the veterans.  Barnes  \nhe did not know what's going on the hospitals.. People were trying to get appointments read schedule and read  schedule we do not know how many die because of this. You refuse to take responsibility for this. Wake Up America",

On the other hand the Clinton's have shown us their Republican-like characteristics over the last few days. Wish I was American so I can vote and it would definitely be a vote for the Democrats. That said I wouldn't want to vote for Hillary only to make history by having the first US female president elected. When it comes down to the wire I think Bernie is the best guy for America. America needs and deserves someone that cares more about the people rather than about creating dynasties and keeping corporates satisfied. It's the United States, and all people should be united (inclusively) for the good of America.",

    "Comment": "The Democratic Party is a classic caste system. First you have their Lower Class peoples. This is the engine that subjugates low income people, minorities and immigrants by forcing them to live on minimum wages, public housing, welfare, food stamps, and free medical benefits on the most impoverished people in this county with no viable means or legitimate avenue to obtain a fair and equitable living. These people have been in this classification for their entire lives. They have less education, fewer people are given the opportunities. Now they need and want to incorporate and legalize over 11 million illegal immigrants who have invaded our country and begin a process of bringing hundreds of thousands of Arabic people to add to this group.\nThen you have their consolidated middle class. This is their engine of union workers across all industries, individual family farmers, agricultural workers, and minority business owners. Union workers are afforded the benefits of Prevailing Wages and Fringe benefits. Prevailing wages are established in each and every job classification that exists. The pay and benefits given to Union members is 3 times to 5 times more income then their lower class voters. Those in their middle class are generally homeowners, receive guaranteed pay and benefits during an entire career and their jobs are protected politically. Farmers and agricultural workers receive farm and crop subsidies. This is arguably the largest welfare plan ever devised in this country. If crops fail, don't worry about it...they'll simply be paid a subsidy through the Farmer Bureau at the end of the season. If they have a great year, don't worry about it...we'll still pay you the same subsidies. If a company with union employees looks like it's going to fail, don't worry...we'll bail you out so our union voting base remains intact. The makeup of most Unions in our country are white males and women by an extremely huge margin. Unions spend millions supporting Democrats across this country. Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton have received millions from unions over their careers as have most Democratic politicians. \"Cometh to the well and you shall drink!\"\nBut above all else is the Upper Class. These are the rich, the bankers, the automakers, the owners of the majority of newspapers, broadcasting companies and the manufacturing corporations. This rich in the Democratic party are amount the richest Americans in the history of our county. Two simple examples here would be Warren Buffet and his Berkshire Hathaway fund. Arguable one one of the most powerful men in our country. There will never be a pipeline build as long as Burlington Northern Santa Fee railroad is carrying millions of barrels of oil to the refineries. No bank that supports the Democratic Party will be allowed to fail. Evidenced by the fact Goldman Sachs is one of the greatest donors for Hillary Clinton. \"Cometh to the well and you shall drink!\"\nThis is the Democratic caste system as a whole. The largest majority of the Lower class are destined to remain in this class their entire lives with little hope of ever moving out of it. The Democratic Party need this class to win elections. They do so to win elections because those in the lower class are less educated and would never be allowed to move up into the middle class. They will simply never be given the means. There has never been an election where the Democratic Party and those politicians running have not promised the end their lives in this Lower class. There has never been any progress for these people as a group after any election. What is even more sad....in the past 8 years, under Obama...the total number of people in the Lower class has grown. The rich did get richer, but they are destroying the middle class to ensure they have their largest voting base guaranteed. Now they want and need to incorporate 11 million illegal immigrants and suffering Arabic peoples into this group.",

Nafta, and the china treaties caused companies to run overseas and south of the border, while at the same time Clinton was forcing banks and lenders to give loans to ppl who were already spotty on credit to begin with. as factories got built and up to operating shipping parts and goods to the states. those same ppl started losing jobs to foreign competition. therefore, unemployment will NOT pay a mortgage or car payment so then they default on them. The bubble burst on it way after Clinton left office and has been unfairly given to Bush, when in fact it was all started with the signing of those liberal policies of Bill Clinton....... ppl tall about how good the economy was under Clinton well guess what? the reason is he INHERITED an economy set up by the previous administrations of Presidents, Reagan and Bush sr. was nothing Clinton did. The term Reaganomics was designed and further implemented by Bush for the pupose of making America great again, and worked until Clinton and his liberal cohorts decided to prop up China and Mexico and send OUR jobs overseas...... a vote for trump is the only sane choice",

Without these three Holy Oracles of God, this Nation cannot stand.  But it will stand because we have all three Holy Documents - Writings of the All Mighty God.  To me, all three are Holy Writ and they are sacred.   \n\nWhen you vote for me you will have to write my name in the ballot box section.  This can be done in all 50 States across America (where write-ins are accepted depending on state.). I will destroy Isis.  We will keep our guns and ammunition to protect our families and defend the Homeland.  \n\nThree of my brothers served and my daughter served 8 years in the US Army.  I love our soldiers.  I will help the middle class.  I will also help the Homeless, the Veterans, the poor, the sick and afflicted, the troubled, the needy, so they can get on their feet.  I was born in Sinton, Texas.  I was born of goodly parents.  I'm an American, born and raised in America.  I am a Conservative Republican and I'm a born-again Christian. I know that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God.  I love my Savior, my Lord, my God, my King.  I bear you my testimony that Heavenly Father lives and his Son, Jesus Christ, are real, in the Holy and sacred name of Jesus Christ.  Amen. \nGo to website and read my vision for the nation, please.  I will save Social Security,.  I will secure the borders,.  I will repeal Obama Care.  I will get rid of the Iran deal.  I will make sure that Planned Parenthood gets no more money.  I will save Medicare and Medicaid.  I will make sure Guantanamo Bay remains open.  Everyone who comes to America will be strongly vetted.  I will strengthen our military.  I will protect the first and second Amendment and uphold The Constitution of The United States. Everyone will pay less taxes.  You will be able to go across state lines and buy medical insurance.  I will make sure you will need only one gun permit that will be good in all 50 states.  Corporations will pay a lot less taxes.  I will take care of anyone who is in need of medical care, whether you have money or not.  You will not be refused medical attention.  You will pay less for medical prescriptions.  IRS will not bother you any more.  I will restart the space program - that's a big part of national security.  I will protect the state of Israel.  We will build more oil refineries,nuclear power plants, solar and wind, coal mines. natural gas, and drill for oil in all 50 states.  I will bring the price of gas down.  You will pay less for your utility light bill.  I will help you with your funeral costs, no more worries  whether to bury your loved ones or cremate them.   No more high price auto, life, or medical insurance.  No more death taxes.   I believe marriage should be between a man and a woman. \n\nPlease go to my website and donate to my campaign.

His views are clearly left wing, and as a businessman, he has looked at what he needs to do or say to win.  That being said, I wouldn't support him just because he has no clue what he is doing.  It would be bad enough as a Senator, but can you imagine this guy controlling the highest job in our country with on the job training?  Then anyone, with no clue at all, can be president.  New job description would be: Ne experience needed.  You learn as you go.  Don't worry about mistakes because you learn from them.",

On the other hand, they say they are leaning towards Donald Trump, who embodies all of the above. This is why it's easy to see that this election is not about business or purpose.

    "Comment": "This is a total bogus line, Trump is not even close to Obama's thick skin, intelligence and just plain understanding of our system of government.  But that's just the beginning, Obama has wade America though the greatest economic depression, greater than 1929; we still had Lehman Brothers, Merrrill Lynch, Bear Stearns.  These are the pillars of American financial power around the world, Lehman Bros was the only bank to sell bonds to build entire state economies in the South, after the Civil War ended.  They were the reason there is a Sear and Roebuck, many other iconic brands that existed for 130 years.  Yet in one month Bear Steans, Lehman, Merrill all fell like dominos.  This is known as systemic risk.  Had the US govt not raised $750 B and bailed out these and AIG the unemployment rate easily could have been 20% like in Spain not 10.7%.   So despite the uninformed who say our government policies do not work, the FDIC created in 1936 and other policies tightening Federal Reserve worked.  The long soup lines of 1929-19134 were avoided, the unemployment was 22% in 2009 unemployment peaked at 10.7%.  Today its 4.9%, even though labor participation rate is low, this very low unemployment level will force wage growth and push those who have given up on jobs to get back in the game.  The evidence of this is beginning to mount.  Trumps polices is ever implemented will tank the economy.  Bec he will not decrease taxes he will increase them on the middle class and he will choke of trade with Mexico and China, which will increase inflation",

Second, how can anyone still believe in Trump. all he's made up of is insinuations, criticism and exaggerated comments. He doesn't have any specific solutions. Except to say. I will make America great again. But, can't say how. I have never seen anyone, so shallow, go so far. Get past the angry aggressive attitude. Be fair to yourself. John Kasich is the only Republican that has the ability, ideals and capability to run this Country. That's even close to Hilary, which is still second to her. W/ Hilary's experiences, First Lady, Secretary of State and Senate, Along w/ Her husbands record as president ( who will be in the White House w/ her). There is no one, that even comes close, to having more knowledge, back ground and success w/ the economy, foreign policy, global warming and world threat than the two of them. For those that, justifiably, hold Bill's indiscretion against him. I say it was wrong, but, if Hilary has accepted it, than so can I for the benefit of the Country..Also, Benghazi was a horrible mistake. It's hard to overcome. But, if you think that any of the candidates are above making the same mistake or worse. Your kidding yourself.",

Obama is fighting to have the UN give 9 million to North Korea to help with their people who need food and clothes. This knowing full well that any money they get will be kept by the North Korean gov't and the people will never see a cent. Lets call it what it is when it comes to the current Medical coverage..

These monies flowed to his senatorial campaign, apparently without question or rejection.\n\nTo make matters even stickier, it's pretty well known that the Democratic National Committee raises millions from Wall St every election cycle. And of course -- the DNC is the sanctioning party of every debate. And the Democratic Party is the banner under which Bernie currently seeks nomination.\n\nWhy has Bernie instituted a purity test that not only implies corruption for the DNC, Pres. Obama, and Hillary Clinton... but also himself?",

Ben Carson the invisible man finally acknowledge that he was being ignored and spoke out..Donald Trump was asked about eminent domain and the old lady he stole her house from no comments from him..Jeb Bush finally burst out of his bubble and rise to the occasion as Donald Trump looks in astonishment as Jeb Bush speak ..Ted Cruz has volunteer for a waterboarding experiment during the next republican debate to confirm that waterboarding is not torture as Donald Trump dumps water into his mouth..John kasich keeps talking about how great his state is and how he is going to balance a 22 trillion dollars federal budget... And Chris Christie obviously took control of a disastrous debate by batching angel face and fake politician Marco Rubio and became the night's winner...and that's how I saw it..",

You sit at home, filling out disability claims, and at some point the evil Capitalist system collapses from all the useless pressure and weight on it.  Now, Instead of real results and profits, it's all debt, which becomes the justification to raise taxes - on the rich.   But, the coolest thing about Socialism is debt comes with it automatically, and so do tax rates of 50%.  To deal with it, the government just keeps printing more money, which leads to greater inflation, so you get more and more people to go on strike, so they don't have to work. Some people will insist on producing, so you raise their taxes to 80% and make them slaves to your government.",

    "Comment": "If a great, powerful man, such as Trump doesn't win IMAGINE us with Hillary Clinton as president?\nNarcism is being confused with brains & boldness. Everything about Donald Trump gives me hope in America again. I am tired of illegal immigrants. Yes I am. I am stupified to why they are given a better way of life than our Vets who fought for the very freedom we enjoy!! Trump will end that. \nTrump will bring back jobs. Trump will bring back entrepenurship and small businesses and manufacturing. Trump will bring back order to the streets: cops won't be ridiculed!\nWhat is wrong with money? Absolutely nothing. Trump doesnt need anyone's $ he can't be bought and that is a G-d given gift. You need $ to live. In Trumps book \"The Art of the Deal\" he states he doesn't work for money because he has enough money. Wasnt King Soloman the wealthiest ruler?  Trump loves work and he is in excellent health at 70 to keep going. He has a very clear, forthright head on his shoulders another G-d given gift. The bible says you work hard, you will be rewarded. Trump's life is an American blueprint for success. Remember, God made Trump and I believe, exactly for this pre-destined moment in history.\nTrump can run a successful company, he can run a successful America.\nTrump is a friend of Israel. He & Bibi are great friends. Trump campaigned for Bibi during the last elections in Israel (a little publicized fact). Bibi won by a narrow margin last year.\nTrump will move the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Israel where it should be. \nTrump knows too well the Christian beheadings & the war called ISIS and he will destroy that cancer before they destroy us. He is anti-mosques where hate is encouraged & the war against Christians is fostered. He will reform taxes. ISIS is a political agenda hidden behind religion.\nI find everything about Donald J Trump refreshing. Shall I go on ?\nHe will give freedom to churches to speak anti-same sex marriages and teach sin without fear of closure.\nHe will put G-d back in schools.\nHe will not back Shariah Law.\nHe protects the 2nd amendment.\nHe will restructure mental health care in this country.\nHe will do away with Obamacare (such a great bill you need a law to enforce it!!) The pharmaceuticals can't buy him.\nHe will certainly fight for equality in the workplace.\nI believe he will dismantle Planned Parenthood. He doesn't need their $.\nIn our world, knowledge is power & money is freedom! Trump has both in aces!! That's why I'm voting for President Trump!!! If the dems win they will be the death of Christianity. Our society will be socialistic. In socialism there is no G-d. Consider that.  \nTrump has a lot of work to do. He is the best one to get the job done. Let's support him so he can\n#MakeAmericaGreatAgain\nAmen and amen",

If you can't hold your own against Donald Trump then you have no place on the stage. I do like the Bush family but you're not your daddy or your brother. Were at a crossroads in this country. A pivotal moment in time where we need a leader that will stand up and identify who our enemy is and will act appropriately. We need a leader who will say what he means and mean what he says. Someone that are enemies no that they should fear. 2016 is the year of a major decision and which way this country is going to go and how this country and app. This is the most important election this country has ever faced since Reagan. And as far as the temperature goes, the day Ronald Reagan got an office I ran free. The hospital. That is what they will do to these people in the Middle East. They laugh at our president now, and we are paying the price. If it continues we might not have a country left.",

    "Comment": "(Re-posted re: #GOPDebate): NOT SO FAST, FOLKS! (Pun, sorry.) VOTER INSIDER PLATINUM and you're missing it???? This was fascinating. I have a theory: What does each candidate's behavior \"behind the scenes\" actually reveal? Replay the footage. Who went off script? Yeaaaahhhh, interesting coincidence, isn't it? Who used his weight to take control and stand beside his fellow candidate? And who, anxious to stay on cue and look sharp, continued to breeze past Dr. Carson? Stay with me. Now I could be mistaken, but isn't it possible that Mr. Trump, who has loads of TV experience, may have noticed that Dr. Carson missed the cue and, rather than thinking only of himself, decided to skip his cue deliberately and stand beside Dr. Carson (in a no-sweat-man-they'll-wait-we've-got-this-sort-of-symbolic-gesture)? Then, completely at ease, indeed waited for the next cue and let Dr. Carson actually go FIRST (the Only candidate to so thoughtfully and successfully do that ). What was interesting was to see how anxious other candidates were to move ahead and \"look the part \" or follow \"their cue.\" Am I the only person that's struck by the symbolism here? Indeed it was a simple gesture, but I think it revealed more about Mr. Trump than the media is acknowledging. He tried to take a \"negative\" and re-brand it. I think the anecdote also says something about how much he admires Dr. Carson. What would have been even MORE fascinating to see perhaps is whether Mr. Trump would have stopped and done the same had it been another candidate. Moreover, nothing against Mr. Rubio, whom I admire and consider very talented, but a worried look crossed his face moments later that was intriguing to me; he's so perceptive that I actually wonder if he began experiencing regret that he didn't do what Mr. Trump did, realizing he walked ahead of Dr. Carson too. In other words, who really led here? Which of these men truly has the most confidence? Who took control of the narrative? Who helped his colleague? Who refused to let the script dictate the next move or rattle his poise? It sounds like a small thing -- but actually, it wasn't. It revealed something -- behind the scenes, a place that voters rarely get to observe. So people can tease ABC News all they want -- I'm actually grateful for the valuable insight. AND TO DR. CARSON'S CREDIT, his reaction also revealed things to me. It's my theory that he wasn't about to walk out on stage as another man's name was being called -- nor simply because a television producer was giving him instructions. He'd missed a cue but he didn't panic or react nervously; he remained poised and was intellectually assessing what his work-around would look like, which makes sense to me; he's a neurosurgeon after all. It's rather absurd for people to question how talented and intelligent this man is. It takes confidence not to panic when the script changes -- and to reach out and lend a hand, even at one's own expense (remember that debate Mr. Trump skipped --while he was raising support, awareness, for our veterans?). Honestly, it's a great quality in a leader. I learned a lot listening to the debate. But I may have learned even a little more DURING THE INTROS. Cc: Donald J. Trump, Dr. Ben Carson, ABC News",

    "Comment": "Nostradamus in his codes predicts 92 Years of peace between the Second World War and the third world war. Hence we arrive at the Year 2037 which ushers in catastrophic changes. The killer comet ( Jan 2037) and killer asteroid ( June 2040) according to the Book of Revelations would destroy one third of the land and one third of the sea respectively submerging countries like Britain, parts of USA ( California and San Francisco) and ancient civilizations. After the 3 1/2 Years of peace war will breakout in 2041. India will be occupied by China. China and Russia will annex and occupy USA and Europe will be devastated by the Islamic invaders by the Mahdi of Greater Arabia who sports a blue turban would see 200 million soldiers kill 3 billion people. Read www.war2037.com for Hindu prophecies which mentions Kalki (Sree Veerabhoga Vasantharaya born in 1965-66 ) will restore law and order and usher in 1000 Years of peace from 2064 onwards.\nThe earth has tilted a weebit as predicted by the Mayans. In Hinduism there are two concepts of Pralay ( partial flooding or destruction) and Maha-Pralay ( full flooding or full destruction). This Pralay will begin in 2037 and nearly flood 80-90% of the Earth. We have reached 0.90 degrees Celsius ( the presence of carbondioxide and other gases due to global warming). Once it reaches 1.5 to 2 degrees there will be super droughts and floods.",

He keeps insulting Trump, even when his territorial exposure is severely limited, compared to Trump, who is vastly traveled across the globe, own assets in many continents. Trump is an independent right wing American gladiator interested in leadership to recreate America, in his own image as, Independent, prosperous and extremely powerful to scare others to submission. He sounds passionately American and desires to see an America that manifest economic might and vastly wealthy... dominating the global economy and political landscape.  No matter how absurd Trump sounds, he seem a lot more candid than many of his opponents. I don't share his views at all but, one can't den how impressive his appeal is among many Americans.  Trump is brutally blunt and candid, unlike Bush who struggles with how best to couch his arguments to win points. Jeb is dangerously duplicitous, coy and parochial, almost delusional about America exceptionalism.",

I am waiting to hear his solutions. He is adept at 'shooshing' (quieting others by making fun of the other person in his attempt to dominate). He does 'a spin'  twisting questions and making it 'look like' he answered. Other than bragging that he is 'great' I have not yet heard a solution to anything.",

    "Comment": "Mary Lou S. Holmes, everything that you think you know about Trump is wrong!  His grandfather, a German immigrant, earned his money running brothels. Fred Trump, Donald's father, became a multi-millionaire through building Section 8 housing for welfare recipients.  Donald Trump was BORN wealthy, & is such a \"great businessman\", that he went to great lengths to disinherit his late brother's children from their share of their grandfather's fortune by persuading the grandfather to change his will. His 3 marriages to successively younger women speaks to his family values. \"Sharia law\" is unconstitutional, as is any official state religion.  No church, synagogue or mosque faces closure because of their teachings on same-sex marriage, just public unpopularity from society at large. Obamacare is just an effort to bring affordable health insurance to more Americans, something that should be a right of citizenship, like it is in EVERY industrialized country in the world, save ours. It is an effort to insure more people while appeasing the insurance companies. All hospitals must, by law (passed under Reagan), care for patients.  They pass the costs for the uninsured to the insured & taxpayers, raising everyone's rates. Why would he fight for equality in the workplace when he has made a career of hiring foreign workers through applying for visas. As for your fears about Christianity, you are wrong. Our Democrats are moderate & if you knew anything about American history, you would know that socialism in this country was founded by Christians & was, at one time, more prevalent.  Socialism is not the same as communism, which is atheistic in nature. No Democrat, no matter how liberal, has ever proposed anything like that. And caring for the poor, the sick, the elderly & the young are Christian values. The worship of money & the \"Gospel of Prosperity\" are NOT the teachings of Christ!",

Any symbol, group or organization that expounds these ideas has no place in our society.We will never forget Auschwitz,we will never forget the people that died or die at the hands of racism.We should all be proactive In fighting the evil social construct of racism.\n\n We haven't moved forward because we still retain some of the racist infrastructure of the past,we recently removed many confederate monuments all over the south which is great step forward but we still have to eradicate the racist groups and all confederate symbols.\n\n May The history teachers never let us forget,but its our duty as a society to remove these threats that hinder the liberty and well being of all human beings and the true freedom of a society.\n\nI call on all Americans to peacefully and ideologically fight racism,prejudice and discrimination.\nOur youth are the key to this battle and they are doing a great job,we must create a culture of disdain for all things racist.We as Americans must rip apart this evil status quo by uniting against all things that continue to let it taint our society.\n\nI don't believe \"everyone is racist\" that is a myth,a social construct, I do believe Everyone is equal,I do believe that all people all over the world are members of one giant family called humanity and I believe that every person on this earth has the right to pursue their dreams and reap the benefits of what they sow and that only cowards and fools would try to hinder anyone of this right based on the color of their skin.\n\nLet it be known throughout all America that there is a New culture arising,a culture that will treat all people equally,a culture where all people will enjoy the fruits of their labor,and a culture where those who perpetrate racism will be severely severly punished!\n\nIn my eyes unfairly hindering a persons success or opportuinites based on their skin or sex is one of the most cowardly,weak,and evil things a person can do to someone.Racist people take the wealth,opportunities and life out of people with this kind of behavior,and the slightest hint of this behavior must not be tolerated and must be destroyed.This type of behavior is a disgusting immoral cancer of our society and it is up to all of us to stop this mindset by changing our society and culture to one that absolutely despises racism on all levels.\nWe won the civil war,we are making changes with women's pay,voting,and military service,we have taken confederate monuments down in the south we are winning!Lets be redundant and continue the fight!!Lets make racial entitlements null and void,I would even say lets disban all racially based organizations of all colors and create centers of humanity,culture,and unity,America Centers,were we all may unite and grow as a nation,thank you and god bless America!",

Second, how can anyone still believe in Trump. All he's made up of is insinuations, criticism and exaggerated comments. He doesn't have any specific solutions. Except to say. I will make America great again. But, can't say how. I have never seen anyone, so shallow, go so far. Get past the angry aggressive attitude. Be fair to yourself. John Kasich is the only Republican that has the ability, ideals and capability to run this Country. That's even close to Hilary, which is still second to her. W/ Hilary's experiences, First Lady, Secretary of State and Senate, Along w/ Her husbands record as president ( who will be in the White House w/ her). There is no one, that even comes close, to having more knowledge, back ground and success w/ the economy, foreign policy, global warming and world threat than the two of them. For those that, justifiably, hold Bill's indiscretion against him. I say it was wrong, but, if Hilary has accepted it, than so can I for the benefit of the Country..Also, Benghazi was a horrible mistake. It's hard to overcome. But, if you think that any of the candidates are above making the same mistake or worse. Your kidding yourself.",

    "Comment": "Jeb Bush is the only GOP candidate who's not stirring up the deep-seated and unreasonable outright hatred (not merely dislike, but rabid hatred) of Hillary Clinton to get publicity and votes. You can actually see his discomfort and frustration in the Republican debates, as he stands by and watches the other candidates get so worked up over Hillary's mere existence that they neglect giving intelligent answers to questions and instead sputter and spit and foam at the mouth over Hillary Clinton. (None of them even mention Bernie Sanders, who is actually ahead of Clinton in the polls!) I'm a liberal Democrat, but I have renewed respect for Jeb Bush for trying to bring some dignity and substance to the presidential race. Unfortunately, he's fighting a losing battle as the Hillary-haters shout him down. He's right -- they ALL need therapy, or at least some intensive lessons in anger management. Their behavior is juvenile, violent, dangerous, and downright creepy.",

It's about a generation of women celebrating the possibility of a female president we can support- something we never really believed could happen, would happen.  Seen too many roadblocks, been told to shut up and sit down too long.  I remember want ads in the paper listing jobs by male and female.  I remember being denied jobs because that job should go to the head of a household (as if women were never the head of a household).  I remember when women couldn't even run in a marathon, couldn't be ordained, couldn't be a freaking member of the Stock Exchange.  THAT'S why they're laughing.  It's sheer joy.  One generation's support of Hillary should not be a problem with another generation who want to support someone else.  Celebrate with us the wonderful possibility that we have waiting so long for.  Vote for whom you freaking want.",

    "Comment": "Hillary was a Young Republican,  unlike Sanders, she wasn't really there in the middle of the Civil Rights movement in the 60s. Even though people can have radical conversions with age, she's honestly barely left of center.  She is a corporate shill, and was opposed to gay marriage until five years ago. She didn't even fathom the fundamental problem with TPP until she realized Sanders supporters were abandoning her because of her shocking,  blind, upper middle class original support of it...it also revealed her to be much less of an environmentalist than she claimed. Yes she's a feminist. Conservatives can also be feminist. Being feminist or a woman doesn't guarantee anything else about her politics,  to be truthful, other than she'll be a feminist. She's like a Reagan Era conservative,  people are ignorant if they don't see that.  She only seems very liberal contrasted to the great neoconservative WTF that's happened over time since the late 80s. Sanders is the best candidate for me, as a woman, period.  I only supported Hillary so strongly in the past because I didn't understand all these things about her, and I knew we desperately needed Healthcare Reform.",

When I went to the University of Colorado in the early 60's, I was told by the Journalism Dept. that if I wanted to pursue Journalism as a career I would always be a Feature writer making $60. a week.  I wanted to write about news and sports. I did not have the know how to stand up to them. I floundered for awhile, but graduated with a degree in Elementary Education which was acceptable for a woman. I made sure my daughter knew she could do whatever she wanted and to always stand up for herself. I think many women of my generation and the next did the same. We should be proud that younger women know this. I think others just feel unappreciated and abandoned by the younger women after all their hard work. They shouldn't because that is what we wanted for them.  Having said this, I will vote for HRC not because she is a woman, but because if elected,Bernie will face Paul Ryan's House. That means no Single Payer, No Free College, No SS increase. It cannot change until after the census in 2020 because redistricting occurs after each census.  Republican Governors have gerrymandered the Districts to be overwhelming Republican.  HRC has a detailed plan that she will be more likely able to implement. I'm just sorry that young women will undoubtedly be disillusioned if Bernie is elected.  I'm done.",

You know that I have started a series in the facebook imparting brahma vidya, the knowledge of truth, as given in 108 Upanishads!\n\nMy long professional experience in teaching and research in many fields other than vedas, unfortunately, encouraged me to write in various social media platforms on diverse issues as education, economic development, religious amity, anti-national activities of opposition parties, media and religious fanatics etc!  After studying vedas and getting engaged in imparting veda knowledge, I should really refrain from all other activites that can cause distractions and affect my main Vedic work.\n\nSo I have decided to concentrate only on spreading the veda message across the world!  My posts are public and people are free to read my posts and use the knowledge to rise themselves to a higher level!  Those who choose to criticize the Vedas too are free to do so!  Vedas need not be defended by anyone; if intellectual debates over 5000 years have accepted vedas as the basic premises, nothing more is needed to defend them!\n\nIn short, no more posts from me on topics other than Vedas and related literature; of course, all important scientific discoveries and concepts supporting the Veda assertions will be presented!  No more presidential election, Donald Trump, Modiji, Kejriwal, Mughal and British invaders, dismal education system etc. from me!  Only vidya and no avidya!  Be certain, avidya is the root cause of all evils in the world!  There is one final request:  those who like my series may do the needful to spread this divine veda message to others!  Good luck to all!",

It's all very parochial to think you are exceptional, that's a mindset most other ex empires got over years ago. Having lived there for 5 years I do miss it and it will always be my second home.",

    "Comment": "Great article.\n\nThe US is the most politically fractured today then ever. During the Cold War we had stability in our country, and the world, due to the threat of nuclear war with USSR. Our client countries always stayed in line to avoid provocation. \n\nSince 1991, the world is facing new challenges; civil wars, middle east instability, Islamic extremism, and Europe's questionable dedication to maintain post WW2 liberal socialism. \n\nThe USA was born from anti-European values...we don't have a noble vs. peasant fiefdom system here, no tyrannical kings, as Europe had for centuries. We made ourselves on the concept of the frontier and old fashioned  ingenuity. You make your own way, which is why millions have come here from Europe and other places...you aren't labeled, your future isn't determined, you can be whatever you want to be, if you work hard enough. \n\nAmerican capitalism and efficiency created the industry needed to save Europe from two world wars...our industrial output gave us the capability to fight a two front war in WW2, AND supply our allies with enough materials and resources to maintain their own militaries. \n\nBrits won't ever admit this, but DDay wouldn't have been possible without the USA. The Soviets, without lend/lease, might not have survived the battle of Moscow in 1941, and almost certainly would never have been able to invade Germany proper. \n\nObama eschews our history because he isn't rooted in America. The illegimate son of a radical leftist African and a liberal globe trotting white woman, raised by his maternal grandparents in Hawaii. He has no identity of himself, let alone his adopted country. Being born here makes you a citizen, but doesn't answer any questions about your self identity. Doesnt answer the \"who am i\" question. \n\nSo Europe is desperately trying to maintain its grasp on its citizens through socialism. Europe was powerful when it was capitalist...today Europe is weak. Your citizens will soon realize that paying 35%-45% of their money to the king is silly, and their money is better off in their own pockets. \n\nSo we'll see what direction our country is headed...we've periodically put our heads in the sands in the past, but always get called to help the world in its problems. One thing for sure, you can take your socialism and shove it...we want our money in our pockets...",

I disagree with the idea that the constitution needs to be tossed out but new laws and policies need to be made to get the US domestically back on its feet. Perhaps we need to focus more inward at the moment, but I would advise against this fortress mentality. I believe the world needs us whether they, or we, like it or not. We still lead the free world, even though we may not always be the best example of democracy or make the best decisions no other democratic state could muster what we can today. Maybe in the future India, Brazil, or a united Europe will replace us but as it stands the US is the most capable and most necessary to maintaining world order and democracy. Russia and China would not be a good replacement, they seem tame now but thats only because they are restrained. A world under them would be a much darker bleaker place unless they were to go through major political reforms beforehand.",

As an American, myself, I see them vote against their own best interest, then turn around and blame the government. The conservative leaders have convinced citizens that our government is an evil empire to be done away with. \"Less government\" they cry. Never mind \"we the people\" are our gov't. Meanwhile corporations use the gov't to further their interests, ie, the U.S. military, tax havens/ loopholes, etc. They tell Americans their tax dollars are being wasted on gov't programs for the poor and needy. Our own Supreme court voted in Citizens United, which means the oval office can be bought by the highest bidder. Americans have no voice; corporations reign supreme. NAFTA cost Americans jobs. The TPP will remove more jobs. Americans are demoralized after having followed the yellow brick road. Trickle-down was, of course, a lie. Americans, who thought they'd get a piece of that pie, are realizing that Reagan and his cronies knew citizens would never benefit from the neoliberal agenda. It is working exactly as it was supposed to. Corporations have no allegiance. America has become a plutocracy under a thin veil of democracy. SANDERS FOR PRESIDENT 2016!",

We are a collage of contradiction and confusion. We have done horrible things. We have done great things. America is in her \"puberty\". We are growing up in many aspects. Our people are from every nation on this planet. We are proud of that. We are still working towards the ideals of our Constitution. Maybe that's our \"exceptionalism\", we can and want to change, we strive to make ourselves better. Maybe that's one of the issues some of you out there posting are actually mad at us about. Your country's are either past their best days, or you feel that your country is already as good as it can get. America renews, changes, we are still growing up, our best is still yet to be seen. Yeah, that's a big part of America's \"exceptionalism\", we can change and still be amazing.",

    "Comment": "We despise Hillary Clinton but this is disgusting because it involves CHILDREN:\nAmerica should have a First Lady who will speak out on the best interests of children. But Karen Kasich tolerates and cozies up to those who got caught while deliberately endangering her very own children and who were secretly recorded stating that they believe \"before God\" that it is \"the right thing\" to do. Imagine how disgusted America would be if Hillary Clinton would tolerate and cozy up to those who got caught having an affair with her husband. However, not only does Karen Kasich tolerate and cozy up to those who got caught endangering her children, she and her husband actually pay money to them too. It is doubtful that Hillary Clinton paid money to those who had an affair with her husband (unless it were to keep them quiet about it). Karen Kasich is clearly unacceptable and would be an embarrassment to our country.\nPlease see and share ABCsOfBetrayal.com and NotKasich.com to help inform voters, warn consumers, and protect children.",

A college degree is the equivalent of a high school diploma 30 years ago anymore and college is too expensive even for hard working upper middle class families, so we have to take out loans that are so large it would be easier to pay a 30 year mortgage than pay those off. Even after you put on the time work and money to get a degree there's a pretty good chance you won't even find a job with it and our economy is set up for us young people to fail. I love his policies but I don't know how he'd pay for them without putting us in more debt than we already are and that's why it's hard for me to vote for him",

He doesn't have any specific solutions. Except to say. I will make America great again. But, can't say how. I have never seen anyone, so shallow, go so far. Get past the angry aggressive attitude. Be fair to yourself. John Kasich is the only Republican that has the ability, ideals and capability to run this Country. That's even close to Hilary, which is still second to her. W/ Hilary's experiences, First Lady, Secretary of State and Senate, Along w/ Her husbands record as president ( who will be in the White House w/ her). There is no one, that even comes close, to having more knowledge, back ground and success w/ the economy, foreign policy, global warming and world threat than the two of them. For those that, justifiably, hold Bill's indiscretion against him. I say it was wrong, but, if Hilary has accepted it, than so can I for the benefit of the Country..Also, Benghazi was a horrible mistake. It's hard to overcome. But, if you think that any of the candidates are above making the same mistake or worse. Your kidding yourself.",

So..maybe it is more important to them to see a woman become president . They see it as the ultimate victory in a long struggle. Younger women were raised in a different climate and don't necessarily see gender as an obstacle or a hindrance in achieving their goals. Therefore, they are putting more emphasis on the message not the gender of the messenger. Bernie Sanders is a progressive whose rhetoric resonates with young visionaries wanting to change the world. Also, despite Hillary's intelligence and achievements she stayed married to a philandering husband which is probably more intolerable to young independent women because it shows weakness and dependency on some level.

    "Comment": "Can't feel the bern! I'm just not rug rat enough. The young population always feel they have it all figured out until they actually experience life. There's a reason they \"feel the bern\", they don't have the experience to realize just how cold and impossible Bern's ideas really are. Being a Bernmite is just a fad and it will become a costly one if Bernus is elected.\nBernie may be warm and inspiring.  He may go after big banks, but he's  comes across as clueless on foreign policy. The thought of our national security resting on his shoulders makes me nervous. You may not like Hillary, but you can't deny that she is knowledgable across the board. Bernie is awesome, but  Hillary will make a better president.",

Have you watched any debates I've watched 4 Republican debates 4 Democrat debates and Bernie has not really said anything logical about foreign-policy and he will never get what he wants domestically across to Congress.  Paul Ryan will not allow any of Bernie Sanders policies to pass through congress.

I am not a republican or democrat but voting for Bernie Sanders would be just as bad as voting for Donald Trump. Trump is just plain crazy and Bernie Sanders will tax the middle class if given the chance, in order to make his agenda real. I've read comments from many people who really believe that they won't have insurance premiums for just a small tax increase. What will happen is that the middle class will have a huge tax increase, as the middle class always takes the big hit,  and anyone living in IL, like me (middle class), cannot take on another tax increase.

    "Comment": "\"By the grace of God, I am what I am\" 1 Corinthians 15:10\n\nCharacter is the determining factor of human life. The purpose of Christianity of Jesus Christ is to create, develop, perfect character. Character is what I am in the sight of God, in the inmost recesses of my being; not what I seem to be nor what I would like others to think I am, but what I am in thought an purpose, in work and in deed. Character is the summing up of all I have thought and said and done. How is it to be secured and strengthened? Paul gives the answer: \"By the grace of God.\" Without it we cannot progress God-wards. With it, we can do all things. It may be had by seeking; its effectiveness may be demonstrated by using. \"By the grace of God.\" we may grow into the likeness of of Christ, which is the realization of the Christian character. \nRev. Joseph M. Francis, D.D., Indianapolis, IN\n\nPromise Land Men's Ministries",

Instead of choosing the best candidate for the job, they are choosing to go with what suits their superficial interests.  In watching all of the Democratic debates here's what I've concluded thus far:  Hillary is nothing more than a career politician who has mastered the art of pandering to gain support.  Bernie comes across as a real leader whose message has gone unchanged throughout his entire career.\n\nIt's disappointing to see the generation I was raised to look up to supporting someone who lacks a shred of integrity simply because of her gender.",

What gaul! Frankly, she is the most corrupt, dishonest, polarizing figure I've seen yet, and should be gracing a prison cell at this point. She's hardly a role model for young girls and women to aspire to in my book. How can anyone vote for that?!

People need to wake up and realize the harm Obama has done. is doing and will Continue to happen under Clinton, Sanders or probably soon to be Biden when Hilary is indicted. The fact Christie desperately tried to attack him here says More about Rubio and much less about Christie. It is sad more people refuse to see this.",

Those of us who have been lucky to be educated, enlightened and open minded are dragging the rest of the citizens kicking and screaming into change.  We are a huge diverse nation of immigrants and people who were slaves that are being propelled by science advancement into giving up many beliefs long held as words of God to comfort many. Religion is again clashing with freedom. The war brought us and Europe smack back into biblical times, to a people  who hold fast to a religion we do not understand. This prefaced by terrorism and dislike of our culture and values has caused us much fear and loss. Some are too afraid and too overwhelmed so they revert to hate. Simply, we have a huge split and the election brought people who want to be president more than caring how they do it. All they have done is uncovered the rotting wound, maybe now we can heal it.",

The reason my husband and I quit watching the news years ago.   We just stuck to FOX and they are getting just as bad as the rest. \n\nSince Dr Carson has been running for President, I've seen the media try and destroy him with lies.  He has bounced back and proved the lies not to be true, but the media has NEVER corrected the accusations or apologized.  Dr Carson flat out told the media he was declaring war on them.  That took guts to do. Who else has done this to the extent he has. \n\nNow I'm seeing and hearing the media leaving Dr Carson out of everything they talk about and post.  \n\nJust yesterday there was a picture FOX posted on their show of all the candidates in NH - everyone BUT DR CARSON.   \nI listen to the radio in the morning and on my way to work.  The media taking about all the other candidates BUT NOT DR CARSON.  \n\nAt one time we could look to the media for information and trust them. We CAN'T TRUST them ANYMORE.  \n\nWhen the media lied about Carson going to West Point, the two people on our afternoon news radio show was slamming Carson and calling him a liar and laughing.  This was a news channel who did not even do their own research or find out the real truth.  They were condemning a man BEFORE they found out the truth. \n\nIt's really incredibly sad that they will do whatever they can do destroy an amazing, honest, ethical, God loving man and they don't see anything wrong in doing this.",

    "Comment": "\"By the grace of God, I am what I am\" 1 Corinthians 15:10\n\nCharacter is the determining factor of human life. The purpose of Christianity of Jesus Christ is to create, develop, perfect character. Character is what I am in the sight of God, in the inmost recesses of my being; not what I seem to be nor what I would like others to think I am, but what I am in thought an purpose, in work and in deed. Character is the summing up of all I have thought and said and done. How is it to be secured and strengthened? Paul gives the answer: \"By the grace of God.\" Without it we cannot progress God-wards. With it, we can do all things. It may be had by seeking; its effectiveness may be demonstrated by using. \"By the grace of God.\" we may grow into the likeness of of Christ, which is the realization of the Christian character. \nRev. Joseph M. Francis, D.D., Indianapolis, IN\n\nPromise Land Men's Ministries",

She used that word as a way to describe just how weak he is on taking care of hard problems. So what Trump repeated it, at least he was using it as a way to describe someone's weakness. There is not a man woman or child over 11 that has not used that word to describe a politician. You say it's not Presidential, at least he used it in a way to describe someone, unlike Bill Clinton when he was in office he used it in a way to bring him more of.  So quit with the bashing of Trump,we know your station does not want him as President as we see every day. Go ahead bring on Ana Navarro , Donna Brazile and Alice Stewart so they can put Trump down and promote their candidates.",

    "Comment": "10,000 refugee (migrated ) children r missing in europe. This is simply an horrible and painful news for any normal human being. Who knows how many of them r crying and r being tortured now. I think its impossible for any gang or criminal group to kidnap these children in a place like europe without any knowledge of the govts. of respective countries. Is it a state sponsored terrorism !!! What will be the fate of these children !! These countries must be held responsible from where they r disappeared. These countries must find out the children and save them from abuse of criminal groups. The criminals must be brought under justice and face punishment. Pls everyone, raise ur voice, if you really care about these innocent children and want to save them from abuse by the criminals. Its a disgrace for human history !!!! Be a part of this campaign !!!!",
