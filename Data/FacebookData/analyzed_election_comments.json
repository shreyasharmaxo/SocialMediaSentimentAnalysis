I have to consider the welfare of my kids  It may be the most important election of our lifetime but especially theirs. WW3 is coming trust me! With a draft including women. There's a bill in the house right now to add women to the draft.  Why if they don't expect a big war would they need a draft?  This election is the biggest of our lives and I have to consider my kids and the future.  Too often we live in the here  and now without thinking ahead.  Iraq is an example.  G.W. didn't think about the 10 yrs down the road or the power vacuum attacking Iraq would leave.  Bush Sr. and Col. Colin Powell did.  It's why they stopped short of Bagdad in Desert Storm and set up no fly zones that were working.  I think like a soldier.  I smell death, you never forget, I see the blood, the death of children.  I see their bodies in the street bloading. So many that they rot for days weeks before we can bury them.  The sickening sweet smell of dead bodies is everywhere.  Then there's the wide spread distruction.  The desimation of historical sights that have lived through a thousand years of war til this one.  Thousands of years of history that lynks us all together... gone forever.  Our kids and grand kids will never be able to see these beautiful historic sights or learn about them.  They're gone now.  War is a terrible terrible thing and too often we set here insulated from it and forget it's even going on.

I wont have to fight.  I'll be ok.  They wont and they have their whole lives ahead of them.  I don't want to see it snuffed out for a unjust war that started on lies of WMDs.

If United States were to invade it would be perceived by terrorist as a holy war... Christians against Muslims. And that is exactly what ISIS wants.

This is why DEDICATION, EXPERIENCE, CIVILITY AND COMMON SENSE, should lead the way.           HRC>>>>", "polarity": 0.08288888888888889, "topic": "election"}, {"rawText": "Trump is a train wreck.

(Pun, sorry.) VOTER INSIDER PLATINUM and you're missing it???? This was fascinating. I have a theory: What does each candidate's behavior \"behind the scenes\" actually reveal? Replay the footage. Who went off script? Yeaaaahhhh, interesting coincidence, isn't it? Who used his weight to take control and stand beside his fellow candidate? And who, anxious to stay on cue and look sharp, continued to breeze past Dr. Carson? Stay with me. Now I could be mistaken, but isn't it possible that Mr. Trump, who has loads of TV experience, may have noticed that Dr. Carson missed the cue and, rather than thinking only of himself, decided to skip his cue deliberately and stand beside Dr. Carson (in a no-sweat-man-they'll-wait-we've-got-this-sort-of-symbolic-gesture)? Then, completely at ease, indeed waited for the next cue and let Dr. Carson actually go FIRST (the Only candidate to so thoughtfully and successfully do that ). What was interesting was to see how anxious other candidates were to move ahead and \"look the part \" or follow \"their cue.\" Am I the only person that's struck by the symbolism here? Indeed it was a simple gesture, but I think it revealed more about Mr. Trump than the media is acknowledging. He tried to take a \"negative\" and re-brand it. I think the anecdote also says something about how much he admires Dr. Carson. What would have been even MORE fascinating to see perhaps is whether Mr. Trump would have stopped and done the same had it been another candidate. Moreover, nothing against Mr. Rubio, whom I admire and consider very talented, but a worried look crossed his face moments later that was intriguing to me; he's so perceptive that I actually wonder if he began experiencing regret that he didn't do what Mr. Trump did, realizing he walked ahead of Dr. Carson too. In other words, who really led here? Which of these men truly has the most confidence? Who took control of the narrative? Who helped his colleague? Who refused to let the script dictate the next move or rattle his poise? It sounds like a small thing -- but actually, it wasn't. It revealed something -- behind the scenes, a place that voters rarely get to observe. So people can tease ABC News all they want -- I'm actually grateful for the valuable insight. AND TO DR. CARSON'S CREDIT, his reaction also revealed things to me. It's my theory that he wasn't about to walk out on stage as another man's name was being called -- nor simply because a television producer was giving him instructions. He'd missed a cue but he didn't panic or react nervously; he remained poised and was intellectually assessing what his work-around would look like, which makes sense to me; he's a neurosurgeon after all. It's rather absurd for people to question how talented and intelligent this man is. It takes confidence not to panic when the script changes -- and to reach out and lend a hand, even at one's own expense (remember that debate Mr. Trump skipped --while he was raising support, awareness, for our veterans?).
